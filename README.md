a simple application in c#, practicing my skills.


It's not really anything that most practicing coders couldn't do in a few hours.
Trying to practice skills in data management, seperating concerns, thread stuff.
So theres a LOT missing. A LOT WRONG --> I needed to put it somewhere safe before i broke another one, 
Cheers.
